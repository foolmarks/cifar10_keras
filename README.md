# Cifar10_Keras
CIFAR10 machine learning example using Tensorflow & Keras

Tested with Tensorflow ver 1.12

Demonstrates the following:

 - how to create a simple CNN using a Keras sequential model
 - how load the CIFAR10 dataset and normalize the image values.
 - how to set up Keras callbacks for Tensorboard logging, early stopping and checkpoint saving.
 - how to compile, train, evaluate the model.
 - how to make predictions with the trained model.
 - how to save the Keras model as HDF5 and JSON formats.
 - how to freeze the TF graph to a protobuf file from Keras
